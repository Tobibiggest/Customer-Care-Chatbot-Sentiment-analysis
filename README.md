## Description

This project showcases a chatbot designed to enhance customer service by providing real-time, dynamic responses. The chatbot is capable of:
- **Responding to Common Queries**: It offers predefined responses for frequent inquiries, such as "refund" or "order status."
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: For general queries, it uses the **BlenderBot** model to generate thoughtful, contextually relevant responses.
- **Sentiment-Aware Interactions**: It adjusts the tone of its responses based on the userâ€™s sentiment using **DistilBERT**, showing empathy for negative feedback.

## Methodology

The workflow of the chatbot is as follows:

1. **User Input**: The chatbot receives input from the user through a text-based interface.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The input is passed to a sentiment analysis model (DistilBERT) to determine if the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.
3. **Response Generation**:
   - If the input matches specific customer service scenarios (e.g., "refund"), the chatbot provides predefined responses.
   - If no match is found, the **BlenderBot** model generates a response based on the conversation context.
4. **Tone Adjustment**: If the sentiment is negative, the chatbot adjusts its response to be more empathetic and understanding.
5. **Response Display**: The generated response is then displayed on the front-end in a chat-like format.

## Tools and Technologies

- **BlenderBot Model**: Used for generating context-aware responses.
- **DistilBERT**: Pre-trained sentiment analysis model for identifying user emotions.
- **Django**: Backend framework to handle HTTP requests and manage the chatbot's logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the chatbot's user interface.
- **JavaScript (AJAX)**: Allows real-time communication between the front-end and backend.
- **Python**: Powers the backend and integrates the machine learning models.

## Deployment Scenarios

This chatbot can be deployed in various environments such as:

- **Customer Service Platforms**: Automate responses to FAQs, improving the efficiency of customer support teams.
- **E-commerce Sites**: Handle real-time inquiries related to orders, refunds, or product availability.
- **Corporate Websites**: Provide automated helpdesk support to clients and employees, handling basic queries before escalating them to human agents.
